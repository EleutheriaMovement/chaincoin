            <h2>About arbitrage</h2>
            <ul>
                Arbitrage in the context of cryptocurrency trading refers to the practice of taking advantage of price differences between different markets or exchanges. This involves buying a cryptocurrency at a lower price on one exchange and simultaneously selling it at a higher price on another exchange. The goal is to make a profit from the price discrepancy, and this can be particularly lucrative in the volatile and fragmented world of cryptocurrencies.

            <h2>Keypoints of Crypto arbitrage</h2>
            <ul>
			</ul>
			<li>Price Discrepancy: Cryptocurrencies can have different prices across various exchanges due to differences in liquidity, trading volume, and local demand.</li>
			<li>Speed: Arbitrage opportunities often exist for a short period, requiring traders to act quickly to capitalize on them.</li>
			<li>Low Risk: Since arbitrage involves simultaneous buy and sell orders, it is generally considered a low-risk strategy compared to other forms of trading.</li>
			<li>Efficiency: Automated trading systems and bots can enhance the efficiency of arbitrage by executing trades faster than manual trading.</li>
